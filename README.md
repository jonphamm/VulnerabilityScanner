<h1>Vulnerability Scanning Using Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves the process of installing and configuring the Nessus Essentials vulnerability scanning software to perform vulnerability scans against a Virtual Machine (VM) Host. For this project, I decided to use Windows 10 as my VM Host where I will perform credentialed, as well as uncredentialed, vulnernability scans against the host machine. Within the host machine, I have set-up the scanning settings to purposefully make it more vulnerable. An adjustment to the Windows 10 VM included the removal of the host firewall protection and the installation of a vulnerable software. The vulnerable software I installed was a deprecated Firefox version, 3.6.12.

To begin, I attempted a vulnerability scan without credentials of the target machine (Windows 10 VM) to emphasize the fact that in some cases, even devices without credentials may reveal vulnerabilities. Although scans without credentials could result in far less vulnerabilites on average, they are still useful for organizations that want to ensure minimal to no effect on their digital infrastrcture by malicious intruders that try to gain knowledge of and exploit. In our case, the few vulnerabilities present on our host machine mostly listed information about certain parameters of the machine that either do not present a pathway for any serious exploitation, while others might provide sophisticated attackers with avenues to probe the machines and identify genuine vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilites are categorized by Nessus as "info" which are not necessarily a vulnerability, but useful information to be aware of. 

, paused and uninstalled any current Windows updates, .....


It is important to note the significant amount of vulnerabilities one's device might have due to the use of outdated software and improper security measures. 



-Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: Discover, Prioritize, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify.
-Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus; remediated vulnerabilities.
-Developed automated remediation process to preemptively deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software. 


-Remediated vulnerabilites by uninstalling deprecated Firefox and performing system Windows updates.
