<h1>Vulnerability Scanning Using Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project involves the process of installing and configuring the Nessus Essentials vulnerability scanning software to perform vulnerability scans against a Virtual Machine (VM) Host. This project also includes the analysis of the vulnerability scan reports provided by Nessus. For the VM Host, I decided to use a Windows 10 environment where I will perform credentialed and uncredentialed, vulnerability scans against the host machine. Within the host machine, I have set up the scanning settings to purposefully make it more vulnerable. An adjustment to the Windows 10 VM included the removal of the host firewall protection and the installation of vulnerable software. The vulnerable software I installed was a deprecated Firefox version, 3.6.12.</p>

<p>To begin, I attempted a vulnerability scan without the credentials of the target machine (Windows 10 VM). Although scans without credentials could result in far less vulnerabilities on average, they are still useful for organizations that want to ensure minimal to no effect on their digital infrastructure. In our case, the few vulnerabilities present on our host machine mostly listed information about certain parameters of the machine that either do not present a pathway for any serious exploitation, while others might provide sophisticated attackers with avenues to probe the machines and identify genuine vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are categorized by Nessus as "info" which are not necessarily a vulnerability, but useful information to be aware of.</p>

<p>For the credential vulnerability scan, I made several additional changes to the Windows 10 VM Host. I paused and uninstalled any current Windows updates, made adjustments to the User Access Control (UAC) settings, an edit within the Windows Registry, allowed network discovery, and enabled file and printer sharing. After running the credentialed vulnerability scan, there were a lot more vulnerabilities identified as compared to the uncredentialed scan, which was expected. It is important to note the significant number of vulnerabilities one's device might have due to the use of outdated software and improper security measures.</p>

<p>After identifying and looking at the vulnerabilities present in the credentialed and uncredentialed scans, the next steps were to remediate the vulnerabilites. I started by reversing some of the changes I previously made to the Windows 10 VM Host. I installed all of the necessary Windows 10 updates to ensure the system was up to date, turned the host firewall protection back on, uninstalled the deprecated version of Firefox, and disabled file and printer sharing. After making these new adjustments, I ran a new scan, which resulted in a much lower amount of vulnerabilities identified.</p>

<p>In the end, this project allowed for a more in-depth look at the abilities of Nessus and how one can use it to detect vulnerabilities within a system. This project also includes the analysis of the vulnerability scan reports in order to indicate the different types of risks that could be present and the importance of remediating these vulnerabilities. Nessus also allows the user to look at the vulnerabilites in detail as well as providing a solution to remediate the vulnerability, which is very beneficial to an individual or organization trying to maintain a strong digital infrastructure. Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope you try out this project for yourself and take advantage of this wonderful vulnerability scanning tool, Nessus.</p>
